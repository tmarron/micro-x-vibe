Using the new linear actuator with 2 rubber feet. Crane suspension is off. Hooked up to channel 1 of the Dsi1000 amplifier (all settings default straight from the box).

So, shaking in Z.

No vacuum, dampers 'correctly' attached:

1: FEA Z
2: insert Z

Plugging Insert into input 1 and FEA into input 2 and taking 3 data sets per run
3: Insert Z
4: FEA Z
5: Ratio (FEA/Insert)

As above but under vacuum:
6: Insert Z
7: FEA Z
8: Ratio Z

Under vacuum (7mbar) with top dampers unbolted
9: Insert Z
10: FEA Z
11: Ratio Z

Under vacuum (7mbar) with shims in
12: Insert Z
13: FEA Z
14: Ratio Z
