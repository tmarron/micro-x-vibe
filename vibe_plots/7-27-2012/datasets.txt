UFO mounted on Y-axis.

1: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Random noise with amp at 1/4 power
2: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Random noise with amp at 1/2 power
3: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Random noise with amp at 3/4 power
4: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 50 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
5: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 100 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
6: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 200 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
7: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 400 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
8: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 800 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
9: Vibe in y, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep with quickly changing the amp volume 100 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
10: Vibe in x, measure in z with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 200 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
11: Vibe in x, measure in y with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 200 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
12: Vibe in x, measure in x with both PCBs. Sine Sweep 1/3 power 200 pts/decade (10Hz - 1kHz)
13: Same as #12 with no foam underneath
