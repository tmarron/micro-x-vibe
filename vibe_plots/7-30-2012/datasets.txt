Cage on the floor with 4 pieces of foam.

UFO mounted on the X side:
1: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Z
2: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Y
3: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring X

UFO mounted on the Y side:
4: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring X
5: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Y
6: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Z

UFO mounted on the Z side:
7: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Z
8: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring Y
9: Sine Sweep 10-1000Hz. Monitoring X

10: Same as 7
Re-center UFO
11: Same as 10
12: Same as 11 but with accelerometer on insert rotated most of the way around (it doesn't fit 180 degrees from where it was).
13: Same as 11 but with new accelerometer position so we can do a full 180 turn.  X was pointing the correct way in the previous tests.
14: Same as 13 but with accelerometer on the insert rotated 180 degrees (X pointing toward -X).


Moved UFO to X-axis, accelerometer on Insert is in new location facing the correct way
15: Measuring Z-axis with random noise
16: Measuring Z-axis with sin sweep
17: Move the UFO to the right by ~1"
18: Move the UFO to the right by ~2"
19: Move the UFO to the right by ~3"
20: Move the UFO to the right by ~4"
21: Move the UFO back to center
22: Same as 21
23: Same as 21, but with accelerometer back in the old position (facing correctly)
