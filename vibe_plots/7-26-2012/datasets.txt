UFO mounted on top (z-axis). PCB accelerometers mounted on both the FEA and cage. No cheap accelerometer anywhere.

1: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring z-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
2: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring y-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
3: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring x-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
4: Repeat of #1

Moved the cage PCB accelerometer to the FWD insert (opposite side of the insert)

5: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring z-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
6: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring y-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
7: Vibe in Z-axis. Measuring x-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.

8: Same as #5, but with a sin sweep with the amp volume set at about 1/4.

Reoriented the UFO on its side so that it vibrates along the Y-axis

9: Vibe in y-axis. Measuring z-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
10: Vibe in y-axis. Measuring y-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
11: Vibe in y-axis. Measuring x-axis on both PCB accelerometers and ratioing them. 10 averages of a random noise source. Log magnitude scale.
