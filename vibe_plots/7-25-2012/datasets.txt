UFO vibrating on top of the insert cube, which is resting on foam. 
measured signal is the FEA accelerometer divided by the (cheap) accelerometer on the cube. 

1: vibe in z, measure in y (divided by z on cheap)
2: vibe in z, measure in x (divided by z on cheap)
3: vibe in z, measure in z
4: vibe in y, measure in x (divided by z on cheap)
5: vibe in y, measure in y (divided by z on cheap)
6: vibe in y, measure in z

measured signal is the FEA accelerometer divided by source 

7: vibe in y, measure in z

measured signal is the cheap accelerometer divided by source

8: vibe in y, measure in z

measured signal is the FEA accelerometer divided by the (cheap) accelerometer on the cube.

9: vibe in y, measure in y (divided by y on cheap)

10: vibe in y, measure in y (pcb divided by cheap). Random noise log resolution instead of sin sweep. 10 averages.

11: vibe in y, measure in x (pcb divided by cheap). Random noise log resolution instead of sin sweep. 10 averages.

Moved UFO back to top of cage for z-axis vibe

12: vibe in z, measure in x (pcb divided by cheap). Random noise log resolution instead of sin sweep. 10 averages.

13: vibe in z, measure in y (pcb divided by cheap).  Random noise log resolution instead of sin sweep. 10 averages.
