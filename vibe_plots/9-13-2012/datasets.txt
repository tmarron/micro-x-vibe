Insert is mounted on an aluminum plate 30"x30" 3/16" thick. Weight ~15 pounds. Three rubber dampers are attached to the plate with bigfoot in the center. Foam is placed underneath the dampers so they touch the plate.

Another plate is attached to the top of the Insert cage so that weight can be added. This plate is also bolted to the insert cage

The insert is aligned so that the FEA is near the ground (i.e. opposite what we usually do).
